# colorenv

The idea is to be able to adjust base16-style themes in a TUI with immediate
feedback. Basically, I like the idea of using a limited color palette with a
strong, consistent theme throughout all terminal applications. But I always find
myself wishing I could tweak themes to my liking, rather than sift through
hundreds of them for the closest approximation.

Work in progress. Uses the [`tcell`](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) and
[`tview`](https://github.com/rivo/tview) libraries. The preview window isn’t
working, and it’s been a while since I last worked on it. When it works, it’s
pretty cool. I still intend to turn this into a useful program at some point,
but the main point of it was to get some familiarity with Go.

For now, clone it and try `go run .`—who knows what will happen?!
